About
---

I'm a front-end engineer working at Tencent [ISUX](http://isux.tencent.com). I'm really good at html, css, javascript and all kinds of relative stuff: responsive design, web optimization, project architecture, browser compatibility, semantization, SEO etc. To know more, check my [profile](http://yuguo.us/profile) please.

As for back-end development, I'm familiar with PHP and NodeJs. I have an open-source project [33pu](https://github.com/yuguo/33pu), which is write based on CodeIgniter Framework.

I'm also an iOS developer, working at my own project just for fun. I'm familiar with both native iOS development and html5/css3 wrapper App development -- like phonegap.

I love reading book, I read book every day. I've translated the famous [*Smashing Book #3: Redesign the web*](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-3-printed-and-or-ebook.html), the Chinese version [*zhong miao zhi men*](http://book.douban.com/subject/23008807/) is now on offer.

I'm now living in Shenzhen, China.
