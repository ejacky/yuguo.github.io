About
---

I'm a senior front-end engineer working at Tencent [ISUX](http://isux.tencent.com). I'm really good at html, css, javascript and all kinds of relative stuff: responsive design, web optimization, project architecture, browser compatibility, semantization, SEO, workflow etc. To know more, check my [profile](http://yuguo.us/profile) please.

As for back-end development, I'm familiar with PHP and NodeJs. I have an open-source project [33pu](https://github.com/yuguo/33pu), which is created based on CodeIgniter Framework.

I'm also an iOS developer, working at my own project just for fun. I'm familiar with both native iOS development and hybird App development -- like phonegap.

I love reading book, I read book every day. I've translated the famous [*Smashing Book #3: Redesign the web*](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-3-printed-and-or-ebook.html), the Chinese version [*zhong miao zhi men*](http://book.douban.com/subject/23008807/) is now on offer.

I'm now living in Shenzhen, China.
